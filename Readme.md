# Naga

Naga is the Sanskrit word for cobra; and here is a terminal implementation of the single most important game ever created by mankind!

## Installation

I have successfully tested naga only on **ubuntu** and **OS X** workstations, but it should work elsewhere as well. Note that **ncurses** and **pthread** libraries should be installed on your computer to play naga.

To run **naga**,

```
$ git clone http://github.com/anayjoshi/naga
$ cd naga
$ make
$ ./naga
```

You can install **naga** using

```
$ sudo make install
```
 
## How to Play

- `w-a-s-d` to move the snake around
- `q` to quit the game
- the symbol `$` indicates food
- score is mentioned in the bottom right corner of the screen
- the naga's head is represented by `#` and the rest of its body is represented by `*`
