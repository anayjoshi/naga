# Naga

Naga is the Sanskrit word for cobra; and here is a terminal implementation of the single most important game ever created by mankind!

## Install

I have tested naga on **ubuntu** and **OS X**, but it should work elsewhere as well. Naga depends on **ncurses** and **pthread**. 

```
$ git clone http://github.com/anayjoshi/naga
$ cd naga
$ make install
```

You can alternatively use *scons* to do the same
 
## How to Play

- `w-a-s-d` to move the snake around
- `q` to quit the game
- the symbol `$` indicates food
- score is mentioned in the bottom right corner of the screen
- the naga's head is represented by `#` and the rest of its body is represented by `*`
